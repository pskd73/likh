`# 💡 Retro Note - Philosophy
Writing is not just framing some random words. It is giving shape and structure our vague thoughts. Writing is thinking. Being good at writing makes one good at __articulating thoughts__ which is very fundamental instrument in building human societies. __Retro Note__ is a place where you can write your mind and build better writing habits.

## ✍️ Build writing habits
This is the core purpose of this tool. It helps you in building writing habits at core. There are multiple ways by which this is achieved at Retro Note. One of the major issues with people who have very initial crush on writing is the topics to write about. They open the note taking app and just go blank. This is where __Retro Note__ shines. In short this will be the flow
1. Add the areas you are interested in. For example
    - Product development
    - Programming
    - Philosophy
    - Agriculture
2. __Retro Note__ will start suggesting you __10__ topics from the areas you are interested to build a story.
3. You can even add __Reminders__ so that you open the app every day, refresh the suggestion, pick one and write your mind!

## 📝 A simple, focused writing environment
The best way of writing anything is to just pull a white paper and a pen, sit in open air and start writing what your heart says. That is how our mind gets motivated by the nature and its peace. For a better writing experience, the surroundings, aesthetics, and the environment play key role. You need a peaceful place to build stories. 

__Retro Note__ provides you a minimal note taking app. No fancy options, controls, colors, etc., yet support of __Markdown__ to take advantage of basic styling and layouting.

## 🔖 Publishing
Art's ultimate destination is to please and motivate people. It is important to distribute the art form, in this case the writings, to public and appropriate audience so that people read your writings and benefit something out of it. __Retro Note__ provides you a way to publish your writings to public by in-build blogging solution. You get a dedicated URL, for example https://retronote.app/pramodk73 where all of your _published_ notes are visible. This blog is fully __SEO__ed for better recognition from the search engines.

# 📠 The editor
The editor where you would be writing is built in such a way that it does not come in your way of writing. The app itself is secondary and provides you all possible functionalities right from the keyboard with shortcuts. You will not have any of the fancy options like changing colors, font sizes, margins, font styles, etc. All your focus can be only and fully on building up stories from your thoughts.

Here are the fundamental building blocks of the editor.

## 🗞️ Notes
Note is the place where you write about some thing particular. For example, a blog post, a section from the novel, or a poem, or a topic in the research. This is the lowest atomic form of a write up. All the notes are primarily stored on the _local computer_ until and unless you chose to publish, in which case, the notes would get stored on the __Retro Note__ servers making sure the privacy of your work.

## 🪮 Markdown
Primarily, the form of the content is pure text. You can start writing on __Retro Note__ editor if you know the language that you are writing. You don't have to know any of the styling form like __Markdown__ to get started at the first place. Anyhow, if you are comfortable with Markdown, you can leverage the power of it and apply the stylings, headings, lists, quotes, etc.

This note itself is a very good example of using __Markdown__ to make the note speak better. You can learn more about it here - https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

## 📇 Outline
Long form notes quickly go out of control. More often we keep scrolling the note just to understand the structure of it at a high level. __Retro Note__ solves this problem by showing the index of the note right on the screen all the time whenever you want! You can even click the contents from the outline to quickly navigate to the corresponding section.

## 📠 Type writer mode
The old typing machines are considered to be the best environment to write at. They are pretty simple and one of the main reason for __typing machines__ to excel at writing is how they keep the writers focus at the same point through out the session. May be they were designed that way because of technological limitations, but they are turned out to be productivity boosters. __Retro Note__ provides you very similar experience with __type writer mode__. Once you turn it on from the _Explorer_ menu, the note keeps scrolling up the moment you hit enter and lets the focus point of the note to the middle of the screen. This lets you focus on one point and work on your deep thoughts instead of focusing on every corner of the screen.

## 📂 Save and open .md
Platform lock in is the worst experience any product can provide. You can __download__ the notes with out any restriction to you computer as a simple __markdown__ file. You can use this file to continue the work on any __markdown__ supported application. There is no proprietary format in the notes.
The other way is also possible where you upload a simple __text__ file or even a __markdown (.md)__ file to __Retro Note__ and continue the note taking here. Our focus is to just provide the besting writing experience!

## ⌨️ Shortcuts
__Retro Note__ is a keyboard first app. We embrace the keyboard interaction more than mouse. You can perform all kind of operation right from __keyboard__. Here are few shortcuts

1. New note - ⌘ ⌥ ⌃ + n
2. Open note - ⌘ ⌥ ⌃ + o
3. Previous note - ⌘ ⌥ ⌃ + Left arrow
4. Next note - ⌘ ⌥ ⌃ + Right arrow
5. Index - ⌘ ⌥ ⌃ + i

## 📈 Stats
You can quickly view the stats of the note right on the screen. You can set a goal for the note, for example, __free style, short, medium, and long forms__. You can see the progress at the bottom of the app so that you adjust your style of writing accordingly. You can even view the __word, paragraph, section__ counts along with the __read time__ of the note.

## ☑️ Checkboxes
You can take full advantage of checkbox support in __markdown__ and create your own to-do lists. You can control the checkboxes either from mouse clicks or by keyboard. Following is an example
